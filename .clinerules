# Cline Rules

## Project Patterns
-   **Monorepo**: Always check `package.json` in root and specific apps before running commands.
-   **Context**: Read Memory Bank files at the start of every session.
-   **Path Management**: Use absolute paths for file operations.

## User Preferences
-   **Language**: The user communicates in Uzbek (based on "Bu faylni o'qi va bajar"), but documentation is kept in English for consistency and standard practice unless requested otherwise. *Correction: I will respond in Uzbek if the user speaks Uzbek, but technical docs are better in English or Uzbek depending on preference. I will stick to English for Memory Bank for now as it's a standard.*
-   **OS**: Windows.

## Workflow
-   Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` essentially every time a significant task is completed.
